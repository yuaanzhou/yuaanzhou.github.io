# About Me


I'm a 3rd year DPhil(PhD) student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Oxford. 
My current research interest lies in Probabilistic Programming and Machine Learning, especially in optimizing the design of Probabilsitic Programming Languages (PPLs) and automating efficient inferece algorithms in Probabilsitic Programming Systems (PPSs).


I am supervised by

and
[Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/index.html), and
I am also part of [Oxford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/).
