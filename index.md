# About Me


I'm a final year DPhil(PhD) student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at University of Oxford. 
My current research interest lies in Probabilistic Programming and Machine Learning, especially in optimizing the design of Probabilsitic Programming Languages (PPLs) and automating efficient inferece algorithms in Probabilsitic Programming Systems (PPSs).


I am supervised by 
[Hongseok Yang](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/people/view?idx=552&kind=faculty&menu=160), 
[Tom Rainforth](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/),
[Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/index.html),
[Sam Staton](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/main.html),
and
[Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/) , 
and
I am part of [Oxford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/).
I am also one of the student representatives in [CoGS](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/societies/COGS/) in CS.
